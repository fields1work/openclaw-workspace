## DAY 19 - Tuesday, Mar 4
**Type:** Value Thread
**Theme:** Content creation framework

**Tweet:**
```
The content framework that got me from 0 to X followers in 3 weeks:

40% value (teach something)
30% story (personal experience)  
20% opinion (hot takes)
10% promo (what I sell)

Most people do:
90% promo
10% random

That's why they don't grow.

## DAY 20 - Wednesday, Mar 5
**Type:** Single Tweet
**Theme:** AI prompt engineering

**Tweet:**
```
The prompt that made my AI writing actually sound like me:

"Write as a 20-year-old who works at Amazon, studies part-time, and is obsessed with building side income. 

Tone: Direct, no fluff, occasionally uses emojis, speaks from experience not theory."

Generic prompts = generic content.

Specific context = your voice.
```

## DAY 21 - Thursday, Mar 6
**Type:** Personal Story
**Theme:** The first dollar milestone

**Tweet:**
```
Today I made my first $1 online.

Not $100.
Not $1,000.

$1.

From someone who found value in what I shared.

Proof that:
1. This works
2. You're closer than you think
3. The first dollar is the hardest

$1 to $10,000 next.

Building in public until I get there.

## DAY 23 - Saturday, Mar 8
**Type:** Single Tweet
**Theme:** Weekend reflection

**Tweet:**
```
3 weeks ago I had:
• 0 followers
• 0 content
• $0 online income

Today I have:
• X followers
• X pieces of content

The difference?

I stopped planning and started posting.

Action beats perfection.
