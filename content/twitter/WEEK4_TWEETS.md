30 days of building in public.

## DAY 29 - Friday, Mar 14
**Type:** Value Thread
**Theme:** Scaling from $1 to $100

**Tweet:**
```
Made my first $1.

Now targeting $100.

The plan (steal it):

1. Double down on what worked
2. Cut what didn't
3. 10x the content output
4. Build an email list
5. Launch a $5 product

Math: 20 sales = $100

Execution starts now.

## DAY 30 - Saturday, Mar 15
**Type:** Single Tweet
**Theme:** Thank you + community

**Tweet:**
```
30 days ago I tweeted into the void.

Today I have a community of X builders following along.

Thank you for:
• The encouragement
• The feedback  
• The DMs sharing your stories

This is just the beginning.

$1 → $10,000

Let's get it.
