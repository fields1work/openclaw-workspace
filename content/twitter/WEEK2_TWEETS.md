## DAY 11 - Monday, Feb 24
**Type:** Single Tweet
**Theme:** AI tools comparison

**Tweet:**
```
I tested 47 AI tools for content creation.

Only 3 are actually worth paying for:

1. @ClaudeAI - Writing that sounds human
2. @Midjourney - Visuals that stop the scroll  
3. @elevenlabsio - Voiceovers that convert

The other 44? Overpriced ChatGPT wrappers.

Save your money. Master these 3.

## DAY 12 - Tuesday, Feb 25
**Type:** Personal Story
**Theme:** The moment everything clicked

**Tweet:**
```
Two months ago I was terrified to post online.

Yesterday a stranger DM'd me:

"Your thread helped me land my first client. Thank you."

The lesson? 

Your voice matters more than your follower count.

Start before you're ready.

## DAY 13 - Wednesday, Feb 26
**Type:** Engagement Hook
**Theme:** Controversial take

**Tweet:**
```
9-5 jobs aren't the problem.

Having ONLY a 9-5 is the problem.

One income stream = zero security.

Build while you work.

Not instead of work.
```

## DAY 17 - Sunday, Mar 2
**Type:** Deep Thread
**Theme:** Systems over goals

**Tweet:**
```
Goals are for planning.
Systems are for progress.

I stopped setting income goals.

Started building daily systems:

1 tweet per day
1 video per week  
1 new skill per month

The results? Better than any goal I ever set.

Here's my system ↓
