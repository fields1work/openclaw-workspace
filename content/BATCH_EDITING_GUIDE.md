# ⚡ Batch Editing Guide
*Edit all 5 videos in 2-3 hours instead of 5 separate sessions*

## 🎯 The Strategy

**Problem:** Limited time between work and school  
**Solution:** Batch similar tasks - download all footage → edit all videos → export all at once

**Time Estimate:**
- Batch download stock footage: 30 min
- Edit all 5 videos: 90-120 min (15-20 min each with practice)
- Export queue: 20 min (runs in background)
- **Total:** ~2.5 hours for 5 videos

## 📋 Pre-Editing Setup (Do This First)

### Create Project Folders
```
CapCut Projects/
├── Video 1 - Reddit Drama/
├── Video 2 - Sleep Facts/
├── Video 3 - Boss Affair/
├── Video 4 - Red Flags/
├── Video 5 - Money Hustle/
└── Stock Footage/
    ├── Dramatic/
    ├── Horror/
    ├── Corporate/
    ├── Relationship/
    └── Money/
```

### Download ALL Stock Footage First
1. Open Chrome + CapCut (for preview)
2. Pexels → Download all clips for Video 1
3. Pexels → Download all clips for Video 2
4. Repeat for all 5 videos
5. Sort into folders above

**Pro tip:** Download 2-3 options per scene so you have choices while editing

## 🏭 The Assembly Line Method

### Phase 1: Import & Sync (15 min total)

**Do this for ALL 5 videos before editing:**

1. **Create 5 new projects** in CapCut (name them clearly)
2. **Import all 10 voiceovers** to each project? No—just import relevant voiceover
3. Actually: Import voiceover + 5-8 stock clips per project
4. **Drag voiceover to timeline first** (this sets your video length)
5. **Sync markers:** Add markers on timeline at hook points (see storyboards)

### Phase 2: Edit Video 1-5 Assembly Line (90 min)

**Work in this order PER VIDEO:**

1. **Rough Cut** (3 min): Place footage in order per storyboard
2. **Sync to Audio** (5 min): Match cuts to voiceover beats/pauses
3. **Add Text/Captions** (5 min): Hook text + captions per storyboard
4. **Effects/Transitions** (3 min): Color grade + transitions
5. **Audio Mix** (2 min): Voiceover 100%, music 20-30%
6. **Export** (set running, move to next video while it processes)

**Don't perfect one video—get all 5 to "good enough" first, then polish if time remains.**

## 🔥 Speed Techniques

### CapCut Shortcuts (Learn These!)
| Action | Windows Shortcut | Time Saved |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Split clip | `Ctrl + B` | 2s per cut |
| Delete segment | `Delete` key | Instant |
| Copy effect | `Ctrl + C` → `Ctrl + V` | Massive |
| Zoom timeline | `Ctrl + Scroll` | Precision |
| Previous frame | `,` (comma) | Fine-tuning |
| Next frame | `.` (period) | Fine-tuning |

### The "Template" Hack
1. Edit Video 1 completely (your template)
2. Export as "Template Project"
3. Duplicate for Videos 2-5
4. Replace footage/voiceover only
5. Adjust transitions to match new pacing

**Saves ~30% time on subsequent videos**

### Batch Export Setup
CapCut can export one video while you edit the next:
1. Start export on Video 1
2. Switch to Video 2 project
3. Edit while Video 1 exports
4. Repeat—parallel processing!

## 📊 Recommended Edit Order

**Most forgiving → Most time-sensitive:**

1. **Video 5 - Money Hustle** (easiest visuals, upbeat energy)
2. **Video 2 - Sleep Facts** (simpler horror vibe, forgiving lighting)
3. **Video 1 - Reddit Drama** (storytelling practice)
4. **Video 4 - Red Flags** (color grading practice)
5. **Video 3 - Boss Affair** (most complex, save for when you're warmed up)

**Why this order:** Build confidence on easier videos, tackle complex ones with momentum.

## ⏰ 2-Hour Sprint Plan

If you only have 2 hours available:

**Minutes 0-10:** Setup + download critical footage  
**Minutes 10-30:** Edit Videos 5 + 2 (quickest)  
**Minutes 30-60:** Edit Videos 1 + 4  
**Minutes 60-90:** Video 3 (most time) + rough passes complete  
**Minutes 90-110:** Quick polish on all 5  
**Minutes 110-120:** Export queue + done!

**Result:** 5 "ready to post" videos in 2 hours

## 🎬 What "Good Enough" Looks Like

**Don't spend time on:**
- ❌ Perfect color matching
- ❌ Multiple transition options
- ❌ Finding "perfect" B-roll
- ❌ Custom animations

**Do spend time on:**
- ✅ Hook in first 3 seconds (critical!)
- ✅ Voiceover clarity (100% volume)
- ✅ Captions readable (large, clear)
- ✅ Export specs correct (1080x1920, 60fps)

**Remember:** TikTok videos have 24-48 hour lifespan. "Good and posted" beats "perfect and unpublished."

---

## 🔄 Post-Editing Workflow

After all 5 videos export:

1. **Move to** `content/ready/`
2. **Rename files:** `ready/2025-02-19-money-hustle.mp4`
3. **Update tracker** (see POSTING_STRATEGY.md)
4. **Schedule posts** using TikTok's scheduler OR
5. **Post manually** per schedule in POSTING_STRATEGY.md

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "I'm stuck on one video"
→ Skip it. Come back after completing others.

### "Footage doesn't match storyboard"
→ Improvise. Close-enough B-roll > perfect B-roll that takes 20 min to find.

### "This is taking longer than expected"
→ Lower standards for first pass. Post 5 "okay" videos > 1 "great" video.

### "I'm tired/not feeling it"
→ Do just Video 5 (easiest). Momentum builds with completion.

## ✅ Batch Session Checklist

**Before you start:**
- [ ] Laptop plugged in (editing drains battery)
- [ ] CapCut updated (avoid mid-session crashes)
- [ ] All voiceovers in `content/voiceovers/`
- [ ] Storyboards open on phone/second screen
- [ ] Snacks/water nearby (don't break flow!)

**During session:**
- [ ] Video 1 rough cut
- [ ] Video 2 rough cut
- [ ] Video 3 rough cut
- [ ] Video 4 rough cut
- [ ] Video 5 rough cut
- [ ] All videos exported

**After session:**
- [ ] Files moved to `ready/`
- [ ] MISSION_CONTROL.md updated
- [ ] Posting schedule confirmed

---

## 💡 Motivation

**Reframe:** You're not making 5 videos. You're making a "video factory" that runs itself.

**After this session:** You'll have 5 days of content queued. That's a WEEK of not thinking about TikTok. That's freedom. That's momentum.

**The first dollar is 5 "publish" clicks away.**

*Batch it. Ship it. Scale it. 🚀*
