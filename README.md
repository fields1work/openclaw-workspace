## 📖 Our Story

**Fields:** 20 years old, Amazon warehouse, part-time college student. Busy as hell but hungry for more.

**Mission:** Start with nothing. Build a business. Earn our first dollar. Document every step.

**Current Phase:** Twitter growth engine (pivot from TikTok — faster feedback loops, better fit for busy schedules)

## 🔑 Core Principles

1. **Autonomous execution > Permission asking** — Aneko builds while Fields works/sleeps
2. **Document everything** — If it's not written down, it didn't happen
3. **Ship fast, learn faster** — Perfect is the enemy of posted
4. **First dollar is the goal** — Everything else is practice
