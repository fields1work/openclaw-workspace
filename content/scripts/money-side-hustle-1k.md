## Script

**[HOOK - 0-5s]**
I made $1,347 last week. Without a job. Without selling anything. Without even leaving my house.

**[BODY - 5-35s]**
Three months ago I had $83 in my account. I was desperate.

So I made a list of every skill I had. It was embarrassingly short.
I can type fast. I know how to use Canva. I answer emails really well. That's it.

I posted on Reddit: "I'll design Instagram carousels for $20 each. First 5 free."

Crickets for 2 days.

Then one DM. Then five. Then my PayPal started blowing up.

Last week? 47 carousels. $1,347. Working 4 hours a day.

**[CTA - 35-45s]**
Your "worthless" skill is someone's headache. What's on your list?

Follow for part 2 - I'll show you my exact DM template.
