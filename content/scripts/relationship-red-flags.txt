[HOOK - 0-5s]
He told me I was "the most dramatic girl he'd ever dated." I believed him.

[BODY - 5-35s]
Every time I brought up something hurtful, he'd say I was overreacting.
He forgot my birthday? "You're so needy."
He flirted with my friend? "You're so insecure." 
He broke a promise? "You expect too much."

I started writing everything down. Every "you're too sensitive." Every "it was just a joke." Every time I ended up apologizing for being upset.

The list got to 47 incidents in 3 months.

That's when I realized: it wasn't me. He was training me to accept less.

[CTA - 35-45s]
If someone makes you feel crazy for having standards, that's the red flag. Share this with someone who needs to hear it.
