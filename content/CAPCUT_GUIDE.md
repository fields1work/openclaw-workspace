## ⚡ Quick Assembly Formula (45-60 sec videos)

### Setup (2 minutes per video)
1. **New Project** → 9:16 aspect ratio (TikTok)
2. **Import voiceover** → Add to timeline
3. **Add background** → Pick relevant stock footage or color gradient
4. **Add text overlays** → Key phrases from script as captions

### The Hook (First 3 seconds - CRITICAL)
- Flash text: "Storytime" or "Wait for it..."
- Or start with the most shocking line visible immediately
- Use bold, readable font (Montserrat Bold or similar)

### Body (Middle section)
- Cut between:
  - Static text cards with key story beats
  - Stock footage that matches the mood
  - Occasional emojis/animations for emphasis
- Keep visuals changing every 3-5 seconds to maintain attention

### Ending (Last 5 seconds)
- Text: "Like + follow for part 2" or "Drop a 💀 if you would have done the same"
- Call to action matters for algorithm
