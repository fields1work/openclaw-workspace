## Script

**[HOOK - 0-3s]**
"I caught my boyfriend of 3 years with my sister's best friend... in MY apartment."

**[STORY - 3-25s]**
I was pulling a double shift at work. My boyfriend said he was staying home to stream some games. I had a gut feeling, don't know why, so I checked my Ring camera around 10 PM. 

Not one person. Five people. His boys. And her. My sister's best friend since middle school. In my living room. Drinking my wine.

Called him - straight to voicemail. Drove home. Caught them coming out of MY bedroom.

His excuse? "We were just chilling, babe. You're overreacting."

I changed the locks that night. Blocked his number. My sister still doesn't know I saw her best friend grab his hand on the way out.

**[TWIST/ENDING - 25-40s]**
Here's the worst part: I found out from his Xbox messages that they'd been talking for 6 months. He told her I was "crazy" and "controlling." The girl my sister grew up with.

It's been a week. My sister still tags her in memes. I haven't told anyone. Should I?

**[CTA - 40-45s]**
AITA for not exposing her yet?
