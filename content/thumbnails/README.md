## 🔥 Why Thumbnails Matter

TikTok's algorithm uses thumbnails for:
- **Search results** - First thing people see
- **Profile grid** - Your visual brand
- **Recommended videos** - Getting clicks

**Good thumbnails = More clicks = More views**

## Customizing Tips

Want to tweak them?

1. **Open in text editor** - SVG is just code
2. **Change colors:** Look for `fill="#ff006e"` and change the hex code
3. **Change text:** Find the actual text content between `>` and `<`
4. **Add your face:** Import into Canva, overlay on top
