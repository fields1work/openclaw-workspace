[HOOK - 0-5s]
I made $1,347 last week. Without a job. Without selling anything. Without even leaving my house.

[BODY - 5-35s]
Three months ago I had $83 in my account. I was desperate.

So I made a list of every skill I had. It was embarrassingly short.
- I can type fast
- I know how to use Canva
- I answer emails really well

That's it.

I posted on Reddit: "I'll design Instagram carousels for $20 each. First 5 free."

Crickets for 2 days.

Then one DM. Then five. Then my PayPal started blowing up.

Last week? 47 carousels. $1,347. Working 4 hours a day.

Your "worthless" skill is someone's headache. What's on your list?

NOTES:
- Relatability: starts broke, humble skills
- Fast progression: desperation → crickets → success
- Specific numbers build credibility
- Ends with challenge to engage comments
- Perfect for "follow for part 2" series continuation
