## Script

**[HOOK - 0-3s]**
My boss pulled me into his office and said: "I need you to lie for me."

**[SETUP - 3-10s]**
Not about a missed deadline. Not about a client call.
He wanted me to cover for him. With his wife.

**[CONFLICT - 10-20s]**
Turns out he'd been having an affair with the intern — in the same building where his wife drops off his lunch every Tuesday.
And he wanted ME to tell her he was "working late" when he was actually...

**[STAKES - 20-35s]**
Here's the thing — if I say no?
I'm suddenly "not a team player."
Suddenly my performance review has "concerns."
Suddenly I'm "not the right fit" for the promotion I was about to get.

**[CLIMAX - 35-45s]**
So now I have to choose: protect my career, or protect a woman who baked him cookies last week because she thought he was stressed.

**[CTA - 45-50s]**
What would YOU do? Because I genuinely don't know.
